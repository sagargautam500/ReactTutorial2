## Introduction

This repository is aimed at helping developers learn React by building small, practical projects. Each project demonstrates the use of React features such as **functional components**, **hooks** (like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, etc.), and **Redux** for state management.

## Projects

### Calculator

A simple calculator application built using React functional components and the `useState` hook. This project demonstrates how to manage local state within a component.

**Features:**
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Clear button to reset the calculator.
- Responsive design.

**Hooks Used:**
- `useState`


---

### Todo App

A basic Todo application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This project uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the state of the todo list and persist data in local storage.

**Features:**
- Add new tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Persist data using Local Storage.

**Hooks Used:**
- `useState`
- `useEffect`


---

### Social Media Post

A social media post simulation where users can like, comment, and share posts. This project demonstrates the use of `useReducer` and `useContext` hooks for managing complex state logic.

**Features:**
- Like/unlike posts.
- Add comments.
- Share posts.
- Context API for global state management.

**Hooks Used:**
- `useReducer`
- `useContext`

## Redux Basics

### What is Redux?

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps manage global state in large applications by providing a centralized store. Redux is often used with React via the `react-redux` library.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Store**: Holds the whole state tree of your application. The store is the single source of truth for your app's state.
- **Actions**: Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened. Actions are the only way to send data from your application to your Redux store.
- **Reducers**: Functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions. Reducers take the current state and an action, and return a new state.

Redux is particularly useful when:
- You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app.
- The app state is updated frequently over time.
- The logic to update that state may be complex.

For more detailed examples and implementation, you can explore the **Redux documentation** or check out tutorials online.
